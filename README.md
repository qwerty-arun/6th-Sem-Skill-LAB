# Key Learnings
- Microwave Amplifer Design, S2P file and Transistor Files
- Transistor: GAN HEMT: CGH40010, 10W power, upto 4GHz, VDS = 28V and IDS = 200mA
- Impedance Matching  of circuits using lumped elements, stubs etc.
- All done on ADS
- Importance of using less number of elements. Pi network, network based purely on stubs  etc.
- Choke using inductors. For transistor's gate we give both VDC and VAC. We also use a series capacitor and a shunt inductor with a VDC in series with Inductor. The inductor is connected to the gate of the MESFET.
- The capacitor block DC components (AC input is given here) and the inductor blocks and AC component from entering the VDC source.
